# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## SEO Improvements

- Added advanced SEO meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and JSON-LD structured data to `src/app/layout.tsx`.
- To further improve SEO, ensure you have a `public/` directory with `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` at the root of your deployed site.
- These changes help Google and social platforms better understand and display your site.
